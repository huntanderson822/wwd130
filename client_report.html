            <h3>Client Report</h3>
            <p><strong>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</strong></p>
            <p>I wanted a webstie about golf. I at least wanted it to include basic starter things that everyone should know. I used chat to help me come up with some ideas, but ultimatley I just felt like it matched the vibe.</p>
            <p><strong>How did you communicate with your developer? Were there any issues?</strong></p>
            <p>We simply communicated through email. Very little needed to be said because they did great!</p>
            <p><strong>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</strong></p>
            <p>Yes they did a great job!</p>
            <p><strong>What will you do differently next time you hire a team?</strong></p>
            <p>I think I would like to be more involved. There really was no communication, so there was no recommendations I could make. That is probably the only change I would make.</p>

            <h3>Lead Developer Report</h3>
            <p><strong>How did you manage your development team and assign tasks?</strong></p>
            <p>I feel like I did as good as I could. One of my developers would not communicate with me in general. I heard from him at the begining and then never again. I even had to work on their page. My other developer crushed it! She was so awesome and helpful!</p>
            <p><strong>How did you communicate with your client?</strong></p>
            <p>I tried my best! I would meet with them every time I had an update on the website and ask them what they think. It helped me know what to focus on and things I need to change.</p>
            <p><strong>How did you handle publishing the site?</strong></p>
            <p>It was pretty straight forward. I struggled at first to get it set up, but we got it done!</p>
            <p><strong>Experience with GitHub?</strong></p>
            <p>I loved it! I will probably use it forever, especially as I start building websites for others!</p>

            <h3>Junior Developer Report</h3>
            <p><strong>How did you communicate with your team lead?</strong></p>
            <p>On the dragovich project, it was great! We had a group chat and kept each other accountable. The website looked phenomenal too! It was awesome! The other one, I reached out to my lead developer every week and heard nothing. I didn't even know the site plan. The lead worked on it last weekend for a bit, but still I never even knew what it was supposed to be about. Both me and Alexis recieved no communication.</p>
            <p><strong>Did you understand your responsibilities?</strong></p>
            <p>On the dragovich project was a yes! I knew from day one! However the Moir project, I had no idea, and frankly still have no idea what it was about, or what my responsibilities were.</p>
            <p><strong>Were you able to contribute effectively?</strong></p>
            <p>As much as I could I did. I felt like on the dracovich project, I did pretty good!</p>
            <p><strong>Any issues with GitHub?</strong></p>
            <p>Nope! It was great!</p>

            <h3>General Experience & Reflections</h3>
            <p><strong>Most challenging part of the project?</strong></p>
            <p>I think it was communication. A lack of communication from my lead developer made it impossible to even start. Even on the one I was the lead on, Jospeh didn't answer me, so I couldn't really communicate with him.</p>
            <p><strong>What did you enjoy most?</strong></p>
            <p>I loved having a completley original project to work on. Working with the client and as a lead has actually inspired me to start my own small buisness web development side hustle.</p>
            <p><strong>What would you do differently?</strong></p>
            <p>Personally, I think I would have been more focused on getting in done asap. These projects were not hard. It is way better to simply grind it out instead of procrastinating.</p>
            <p><strong>Do you feel more confident now?</strong></p>
            <p>I do! I have even scored 3 clients to build websites for! One of them is a marketing agency! I have offically hoped on as a marketing/technology specilist for her!</p>
